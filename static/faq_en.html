    </p>
    
    <span id="notreceived"></span>
    <h2>Why am I not receive delivery?</h2>
    <p class="answer">For many reasons, the following are few possibilities:
    <ol>
    <li>Didn't enable "Enable deliver custom rss" switch, this switch local in bottom of setting page.</li>
    <li>Didn't add your gmail address to Amazon <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/fiona/manage#pdocSettings" rel="external" target="_blank">'Approved Personal Document E-mail List'</a>.</li>
    <li>The content of rss link isn't a valid XML format.</li>
    </ol></p>
    
    <span id="whatisfulltext"></span>
    <h2>What is fulltext rss?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Fulltext rss is which contains all content of articles in rss, on the other hand, summary rss contains only brief description of articles. you can confirm it by opening the link of rss.</p>
    
    <span id="fulltextandsummary"></span>
    <h2>Can fulltext rss be processed as summary rss? and vice versa?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Fulltext rss can be processed as summary rss, in this case, program ignore the content in rss xml file and fetch fulltext in original link, this would spend much time, resulting in the number of supported rss decreased. If summary rss processed as fulltext rss, articles pushed to your kindle would have brief description only.</p>
    
    <span id="weekly"></span>
    <h2>How to deal with subscription weekly?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Some rss update weekly, for this type of rss, you can write a py file to directory 'books' with variable 'deliver_days' setted to a Day like 'Friday'.</p>
    
    <span id="moretimesperday"></span>
    <h2>Can KindleEar push news to Kindle more than one time per day?</h2>
    <p class="answer">The answer is yes, follow steps to realize:
    <ol>
      <li>add a python file to directory 'books'.</li>
      <li>set property 'deliver_times' to a list which elements are hours you chose.
        <br />for example : <code>deliver_times=[6,14,22] #6:00,14:00,22:00 push three times per day</code>
      </li>
      <li>optional, set property 'oldest_article' to number of interval seconds between two deliveries. 
        <br />for example : <code>oldest_article=28800 #8*60*60</code>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    
    <span id="urlfilter"></span>
    <h2>How Url filter works?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Url filter is not for beginner,for whom know Regular Expressions and python. urls in list would not be downloaded for saving of time.</p>
    
    <span id="gfwblock"></span>
    <h2>How to do if the gfw of China block some rss?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Change the link to use https protocol.</p>
    
    <span id="imagesfolder"></span>
    <h2>How to put cover and masthead images in other directory when I add a builtin books?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Put a full path in variable mastheadfile and coverfile, for example:<ul>
        <li>mastheadfile = 'books/xxxx.gif'</li>
        <li>coverfile = 'books/xxxx.jpg'</li></ul></p>
    
    <span id="sslerror"></span>
    <h2>How to deal with when occur SSL error in upload procedure?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Some fiends in China would encounter urllib2.URLError: &lt;urlopen error [Errno 8] _ssl.c:504: EOF occurred in violation of protocol&gt;, in this case, change the hosts file of OS, add a line "74.125.229.174  appengine.google.com"</p>
    
    <span id="garbled"></span>
    <h2>Some articles garbled?</h2>
    <p class="answer">For custom rss and built-books without encoding specified, program detects encoding automatically by using http header, html meta and chardet module of python, the result is not 100% accurate, and if encoding detected is wrong, the article may be garbled. Because this situation is very rare, KindleEar only supply a not very elegant solution like geeker: manually change chardet-detect encoding saved in database. steps follows:<br /> 
    <ol><li>login appid.appspot.com by using account 'admin'(assuming your application name is appid).</li>
    <li>input url 'https://appid.appspot.com/dbviewer' in your brower address bar. check encoding of websites in section UrlEncoding. if encoding is wrong for some site, record its ID of database item.</li>
        <li>enter a long string in addressbar of brower, 'https://appid.appspot.com/dbviewer?action=modurlenc&id=dbid&feedenc=fenc&pageenc=penc'
        <ul>before press enter, modify some vaiable follows:
            <li>dbid: the ID of database item.</li>
            <li>fenc: new correct FeedEncoding.</li>
            <li>penc: new correct PageEncoding.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>A method alternate is that change them in 'Datastore viewer' in GAE backend.</li>
    <li>You can obtain the correct encoding by viewing source code of a webpage.</li>
    <li>If you cannot find the website in page 'dbviewer', it means KindleEar never detect the encoding of any page of this website, http header and html meta are used only. In this case, you can set the variable 'ALWAYS_CHAR_DETECT' in 'config.py' to True.</li>
    <li>If article still be garbled after 'ALWAYS_CHAR_DETECT' setted to True, signify encoding detected by chardet is wrong and unmatch of http header and html meta. a final attempt is set 'TRUST_ENCODING_IN_HEADER_OR_META' to True.</li>
    <li>After all, if you tested all solutions hereinabove and the problem not solved, please add the rss to a python file to folder 'books' with encoding specified.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    
    <span id="forgotpwd"></span>
    <h2>How can I do if forgot password?</h2>
    <p class="answer">If you have forgotten the password for non-administrator account, you can notify the administrator to change your password. If an administrator password forgot, you can login appengine.google.com, on the left select "Datastore Admin", delete all KeUser data, all account information will be deleted, and then re-use admin/admin login to your application . Did not find "Datastore Admin"? You can active it in the "Application Settings".
    <br />If you know python, you would find other solution.</p>
    
    <span id="errorcodes"></span>
    <h2>There are some logs likes 'fetch rss failed(450)' in gae backend, what them mean?</h2>
    <p class="answer">The number in parentheses is a error code, besides standard error code, hereafter shows errorcodes defined by KindleEar.
    <ul><li>504:timeout.</li>
    <li>509:file too large, GAE has a limit of 4MB for each file/page.</li>
    <li>452:website don't support visit by https protocol.</li>
    <li>453:websit need to authenticate.</li>
    <li>450:download failed.</li>
    <li>451:other exception.</li></ul></p>
    
    <span id="mergebooks"></span>
    <h2>Why I cannot lookup words in dictionary when 'Merge books into one' chosen?<a name="mergebooks" id="mergebooks" >&nbsp;</a></h2>
    <p class="answer">With option 'Merge books in one' checked, KindleEar set the metadata of book as Custom Rss, you have to set the language attribute in section 'Custom Rss Setting'.</p>
    
    <span id="mailservice"></span>
    <h2>How to use mail service xxx@appid.appspotmail.com?</h2>
    <p class="answer">
    KindleEar supports mail service which address likes xxx@appid.appspotmail.com, xxx is any ascii string, appid is id of your application.<br />
    <ul> <li>KindleEar would transfer <b>content</b> of email receviced to your kindle. if content of email contains  hyperlinks only (a link per line), would fetch url(s) to generate a ebook and then push to kindle. </li>
       <li>Before you can enjoy the feature, please add whitelists in menu 'Advance'|'White List'. A asterisk '*' means allow all sender, or add some addresses like 'xx@xx.xx'/'@xx.xx'.</li>
       <li>Send mail to username__xxx@appid.appspotmail.com would push ebook to kindle of username if account username exist.</li>
       <li>Send mail with hyperlinks of ebook to book@appid.appspotmail.com or username__book@appid.appspotmail.com would trigger a task to download ebook and deliver to kindle directly.<br />
        The list of postfix allowed of ebook refers to <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/mail#Python_Sending_mail_with_attachments">Mail Python API Overview</a><br />
        </li>
       <li>address trigger@appid.appspotmail.com or username__trigger@appid.appspotmail.com is a trigger, would start a deliver task, which effect when subject is empty or is 'all' equal that you click button 'deliver now' in Menu 'Setting', that place book's title in subject would push book you chose, multi books separated by comma.<br /></li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <span id="needlogin"></span>
    <h2>Some websites need subscription(login) to view article?</h2>
    <p class="answer">
        If you need to crawl a website that needs subscription, you have to add a python file to folder 'books', refer to samples books when you don't know how to write a python file.
        <ol>
            <li><code>needs_subscription</code>&nbsp;: Set to True</li>
            <li><code>login_url</code>&nbsp;: Set to URL for login page</li>
            <li><code>form_4_login</code>&nbsp;: Optional, if not set, KindleEar will guess which form in page is used to login, set to a integer indicate the sequence number (where 0 is the first) of the form in page, set to a string indicate the name of form, start with '#' indicate id of form, start with '.' indicate class of form, string only indicate any of name/id/class of form.</li>
            <li>Login to KindleEar, In 'Feeds' page, a new button 'Login info' will appear on right side the book which needs_subscription is True in section 'Subscripted'. click it and then provide the account name and password.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note1: no support site that need run javascript to login or need to input a captcha.</p>
        <p>Note2: for some site special, may be you have to rewirte function 'login' in subclass of 'BaseFeedBook'.</p>
        <p>Note3: the password will be saved in GAE server with encrypted, key for encrypt is a random string for each account of KindleEar, but key is stored in GAE too, so it's no absolute safe, please take the consequences if the database of KindleEar is stolen.</p>
