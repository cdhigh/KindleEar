    <h2>Dows this application require its own server?</h2>
    <p class="answer">This application is hosted on Google App Engine, it's fine if you don't own a server.</p>
    
    <span id="ownserver"></span>
    <h2>How to deploy my own delivery server?</h2>
    <p class="answer"><strong>The formal way:</strong>
        <ol>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/cdhigh/KindleEar/archive/master.zip">Download</a> the latest version of KindleEar on github and then extract it to somewhere, for example C:\KindleEar (we'll use it in the following steps).</li>
        <li>You need a GAE account, please visit the <a href="https://appengine.google.com/">Google AppEngine</a> page. Use your gmail account to login, click on "Create Application", select "others" in the account activation SMS page, enter your cellphone number with your country code (+nn), click "Send". You will receive an activation message on the phone in a while, after activating your account, click "Create Application" again, in the "Application Identifier" field, enter a name of your applications (e.g. Kindleear123). The remaining options can be kept as default , click on the "Create Application" button to create a GAE application.</li>
        <li>Install Python 2.7.x. <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Download</a> the latest 2.7.x source release and then install it.  Do not install a Python 3.x version, because GAE does not support it now.</li>
        <li>Install GAE SDK, which will be used to upload a GAE program. In section on <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads">this page</a>, click "Google App Engine SDK for Python", choose your platform, click to download the corresponding version, then install, all the way "next" without words.</li>
        <li>Go to the previously downloaded KindleEar directory (e.g. C:\KindleEar), use a text editor to open app.yaml and module-worker.yaml file, modify the word 'kindleear' in the first line to your GAE application name (e.g. kindleear123), then save and exit.</li>
        <li>Modify variables 'SRC_EMAIL' and 'DOMAIN' and 'TIMEZONE' in config.py in same directory of app.yaml. You can modify other variables if you want and understand what it means.Using the default values are recommended.</li>
        <li>Start upload KindleEar now. You can use Google App Engine Launcher GUI or command line. Because Launcher is not stable, we'll use the command line in Windows.
          <ul>
            <li>Followed by clicking: Start - Run - type cmd, it will open a command line window</li>
            <li>Change current directory to App Engine SDK installation directory, example: "cd C:\Program Files\Google\google_appengine"</li>
            <li>Enter 'upload' command: C:\python27\python.exe appcfg.py update C:\KindleEar\app.yaml C:\KindleEar\module-worker.yaml</li>
            <li>Enter the gmail account and password (password does not display in screen).</li></li>
          </ul>
        <li>After successfully uploading KindleEar, use your browser to open the site: http://kindleear123.appspot.com (example only, kindleear123 should be changed to the name of your GAE application). If everything goes fine, then go to the last step.</li>
        <li>Add your gmail account to your kindle email whitelist. You should know how to do it already.</li>
        <li>Then what? Enjoy your own delivery service now!</li>
        </ol>
    <p><strong>The easy way(recommended):</strong>
        <ol>
        <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/cdhigh/KindleEar/archive/master.zip">KindleEar</a> and extract it, get a GAE account, create an application.</li>
        <li>Download <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByRickMo9V_XNlJITzhYM3JOYW8&usp=sharing">uploader</a>. (for windows user only)</li>
        <li>Extract 'uploader' to a directory, move the folder of KindleEar into the folder of 'uploader' and rename it to kindleear, then double-click 'uploader.bat' to upload.</li>
        </ol></p>
    </p>
    
    <span id="notreceived"></span>
    <h2>Why do I not receive the deliveries?</h2>
    <p class="answer">There are many possible reasons:
    <ol>
    <li>You haven't enabled the "Enable deliver custom rss" option, this option is at the bottom of the setting page.</li>
    <li>You haven't added your gmail address to Amazon's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/digital/fiona/manage#pdocSettings" rel="external" target="_blank">'Approved Personal Document E-mail List'</a>.</li>
    <li>The content of the rss link isn't a valid XML format.</li>
    </ol></p>
    
    <span id="whatisfulltext"></span>
    <h2>What is full text rss?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Full text rss means that it contains all the contents of the articles in the rss, while summary rss contains only brief descriptions of the articles. You can check it by opening the link of the rss.</p>
    
    <span id="fulltextandsummary"></span>
    <h2>Can full text rss be processed as summary rss? What about the reverse?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Full text rss can be treated as summary rss. In this case, program will ignore the content in the rss xml file and fetch full text from the original link. It costs much time which will result the decreasing of supported rss quantities. If summary rss is processed as full text rss, articles sent to your kindle would still have brief descriptions only.</p>
    
    <span id="weekly"></span>
    <h2>How to deal with weekly subscription?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Some rss are updated weekly. For this type of rss, you can touch a new python file in the 'books' directory with variable 'deliver_days' setted to a day(e.g. deliver_days=['Friday']).</p>
    
    <span id="moretimesperday"></span>
    <h2>Can KindleEar deliver news to my kindle more than once a day?</h2>
    <p class="answer">The answer is yes, follow the next steps to make it come true:
    <ol>
      <li>Add a python file to the directory of 'books'.</li>
      <li>Set 'deliver_times' using a list in the new python file.
        <br />For example: <code>deliver_times=[6,14,22] #6:00,14:00,22:00 deliver three times a day</code>
      </li>
      <li>Optional: set 'oldest_article' to the number of interval seconds between two deliveries.
        <br />For example: <code>oldest_article=28800 #8*60*60</code>
      </li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    
    <span id="urlfilter"></span>
    <h2>How to use the url filter?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Url filter is not for beginners, you need to know regular expression and python. Urls in the list would not be downloaded for saving time.</p>
    
    <span id="gfwblock"></span>
    <h2>What can I do if the gfw of China blocked some rss?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Change the link to use https protocol.</p>
    
    <span id="imagesfolder"></span>
    <h2>How to put the cover or the masthead images in the same directory when I add a customize book?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Set the variable mastheadfile and coverfile to a path, for example:<ul>
        <li>mastheadfile = 'books/xxxx.gif'</li>
        <li>coverfile = 'books/xxxx.jpg'</li></ul>
    </p>
    
    <span id="sslerror"></span>
    <h2>How to deal with the SSL error problem when I upload KindleEar?</h2>
    <p class="answer">Some friends in China would encounter "urllib2.URLError: &lt;urlopen error [Errno 8] _ssl.c:504: EOF occurred in violation of protocol&gt;". To solve this problem, try to add a new line "74.125.229.174  appengine.google.com" to the hosts file.</p>
    
    <span id="garbled"></span>
    <h2>Why some articles have garbled characters?</h2>
    <p class="answer">For custom rss and the builtin-books without encoding specified, program detects encoding automatically by using http header, html meta or the chardet module of python. Howerver, the result is not 100% accurate. If the encoding detecting is wrong, the article may be garbled. Because this situation is very rare, KindleEar only supplies a not very elegant solution: manually change the chardet-detect encoding saved in the database. Steps as follows:<br />
    <ol><li>Login appid.appspot.com by using account 'admin'(assuming your application name is appid).</li>
    <li>Input url 'https://appid.appspot.com/dbviewer' in your brower address bar. Check the encoding of the websites in section UrlEncoding. if encoding is wrong for some site, record its ID of database item.</li>
        <li>enter a long string in addressbar of brower, 'https://appid.appspot.com/dbviewer?action=modurlenc&id=dbid&feedenc=fenc&pageenc=penc'
        <ul>before press enter, modify some vaiable follows:
            <li>dbid: the ID of database item.</li>
            <li>fenc: new correct FeedEncoding.</li>
            <li>penc: new correct PageEncoding.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>A method alternate is that change them in 'Datastore viewer' in GAE backend.</li>
    <li>You can obtain the correct encoding by viewing source code of a webpage.</li>
    <li>If you cannot find the website in page 'dbviewer', it means KindleEar never detect the encoding of any page of this website, http header and html meta are used only. In this case, you can set the variable 'ALWAYS_CHAR_DETECT' in 'config.py' to True.</li>
    <li>If article still be garbled after 'ALWAYS_CHAR_DETECT' setted to True, signify encoding detected by chardet is wrong and unmatch of http header and html meta. a final attempt is set 'TRUST_ENCODING_IN_HEADER_OR_META' to True.</li>
    <li>After all, if you tested all solutions hereinabove and the problem not solved, please add the rss to a python file to folder 'books' with encoding specified.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    
    <span id="forgotpwd"></span>
    <h2>What can I do if I forget the password?</h2>
    <p class="answer">If you are a non-administrator user, and you forget the password, you can ask the administrator to change your password. If the administrator password was forgot, you can login appengine.google.com, select "Datastore Admin" on the left, delete all KeUser data, all the account information will be deleted. And then re-use admin/admin to login in  your application . Did not find "Datastore Admin"? You can activate it in the "Application Settings".
    <br />If you know python, I'm sure that you can find other solutions.</p>

    <span id="mailservice"></span>
    <h2>How to use mail service xxx@appid.appspotmail.com?</h2>
    <p class="answer">
    KindleEar supports mail service which address likes xxx@appid.appspotmail.com, xxx is any ascii string, appid is id of your application.<br />
    <ul> <li>KindleEar would transfer <b>content</b> of email receviced to your kindle. if content of email contains  hyperlinks only (a link per line), would fetch url(s) to generate a ebook and then push to kindle. </li>
       <li>Before you can enjoy the feature, please add whitelists in menu 'Advance'|'White List'. A asterisk '*' means allow all sender, or add some addresses like 'xx@xx.xx'/'@xx.xx'.</li>
       <li>Send mail to username__xxx@appid.appspotmail.com would push ebook to kindle of username if account username exist.</li>
       <li>Send mail with hyperlinks of ebook to book@appid.appspotmail.com or username__book@appid.appspotmail.com would trigger a task to download ebook and deliver to kindle directly.<br />
        The list of postfix allowed of ebook refers to <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/mail#Python_Sending_mail_with_attachments">Mail Python API Overview</a><br />
        </li>
       <li>address trigger@appid.appspotmail.com or username__trigger@appid.appspotmail.com is a trigger, would start a deliver task, which effect when subject is empty or is 'all' equal that you click button 'deliver now' in Menu 'Setting', that place book's title in subject would push book you chose, multi books separated by comma.<br /></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <span id="errorcodes"></span>
    <h2>There are some logs like 'fetch rss failed(450)' in the gae backend, what's the meaning of them?</h2>
    <p class="answer">The number in parentheses is an error code. Besides the standard error codes, hereafter shows errorcodes defined by KindleEar.
    <ul><li>504:timeout.</li>
    <li>509:file too large, GAE has a limit of 4MB for each file/page.</li>
    <li>452:the website doesn't support https protocol.</li>
    <li>453:need authentication.</li>
    <li>450:fail to download.</li>
    <li>451:other exceptions.</li></ul></p>
    
    <span id="mergebooks"></span>
    <h2>Why I can't lookup words in the delivery books after I chosen 'Merge books into one'?<a name="mergebooks" id="mergebooks" >&nbsp;</a></h2>
    <p class="answer">With the option 'Merge books in one' checked, KindleEar will set the metadata of the book as Custom Rss. To fix this problem, you have to set the language attribute in the 'Custom Rss Setting' section  manually.</p>

    
    <span id="needlogin"></span>
    <h2>Some websites need subscription(login) to view article?</h2>
    <p class="answer">
        If you need to crawl a website that needs subscription, you have to add a python file to folder 'books', refer to samples books when you don't know how to write a python file.
        <ol>
            <li><code>needs_subscription</code>&nbsp;: Set to True</li>
            <li><code>login_url</code>&nbsp;: Set to URL for login page</li>
            <li><code>form_4_login</code>&nbsp;: Optional, if not set, KindleEar will guess which form in page is used to login, set to a integer indicate the sequence number (where 0 is the first) of the form in page, set to a string indicate the name of form, start with '#' indicate id of form, start with '.' indicate class of form, string only indicate any of name/id/class of form.</li>
            <li>Login to KindleEar, In 'Feeds' page, a new button 'Login info' will appear on right side the book which needs_subscription is True in section 'Subscripted'. click it and then provide the account name and password.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Note1: no support site that need run javascript to login or need to input a captcha.</p>
        <p>Note2: for some site special, may be you have to rewirte function 'login' in subclass of 'BaseFeedBook'.</p>
        <p>Note3: the password will be saved in GAE server with encrypted, key for encrypt is a random string for each account of KindleEar, but key is stored in GAE too, so it's no absolute safe, please take the consequences if the database of KindleEar is stolen.</p>
    </p>
    
    <span id="deletebookschinese"></span>
    <h2>Can I delete/hide books in Chinese?</h2>
    <p class="answer">
        If you not are Chinese, you can delete some *.py files in directory 'books'. <br />'__init__.py' and 'base.py' are required, please dont delete them.
    </p>

    <span id="pushseparate"></span>
